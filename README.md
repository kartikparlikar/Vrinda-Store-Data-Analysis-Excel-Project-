In this we have been given 2022 data of Vrinda Store and we have to analyze them and tell some insights to increase their sales in the coming year

**So we made some questions by looking at the data**

1.	Compare the sales and orders using single chart
2.	Who purchased more- men or women in 2022?
3.	What are different order status in 2022?
4.	List top 10 states contributing to the sales?
5.	Relation between age and gender based on number of orders
6.	Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
7.  Highest selling category?
